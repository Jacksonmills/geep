All alone.\nAll alone. All alone.\nAll alone. All alone.\nAll alone. All alone.\n\nSnatch a piece of my pondering,\ndistant far like yonder in,\nskin of my tute like, skin of my boot like,\nfly in soup like, where’s the waitress?\nCan’t take this, can’t face this,\nthese airs and all these graces,\nit’s my mistake, I make it.\nStraight up to the boom I bake it.\nBounce wiggle, bounce wiggle\nshaking all the pains out.\nChemical cut throats\nbound to blow the brains outs.\nHurts to the pain, this ain’t no game,\nI feel no shame, I birth this pain,\nI twist the cain, I twist again,\nI push the plain. It’s plain as day\nknown to what the sayer say,\nknown to what these doers do,\nit’s you and who and you know where\nwe about to take it there.\nWe about to make it clear\nwe happy on we lonesome.\nThe lone heart, the beat drum,\nthe start the finish.\nTen spoon of spinach,\nthe soul and spillage,\nthe cup that runneth over,\nreturn of the ogre.\n\nAll alone. All alone.\nAll alone. All alone.\nAll alone.\n\nAah\n\nClose your eyes and see\nwhen there ain’t no light,\nall you’ll ever be,\ncome and save the night.\nCos I don’t need,\nwhen the morning comes\nit doesn’t seem to say\nan awful lot to me.\n\nAll alone. All alone.\nAll alone. All alone.\nAll alone. All alone.\n\nAries\n\nAries\n\nI’m looking out at a volcano\nTrying to read the world today\nAnd see where you’re at\nI never do that\nI’m a model that is uncomplicated\nYou can play a happy tune on me\nBut don’t turn me off\n‘Cause then I’m silent\n\nI’m standing on a beach in the distance\nAnd even though you’re faraway\nCan you see my red light\nIt’s waiting to turn green\n‘Cause I feel so isolated without you\nI can’t play a happy tune on my own\nSo stay by my side\nHigh or low tide\n\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high\n\nAnd it feels like I’m falling\nin again\n\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high\n\nFeels like I’m falling in again\n\nI’m a model that is uncomplicated\nYou can play a happy tune on me\nBut don’t turn me off\n‘Cause then I’m silent\n\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high\n\nAnd it feels like I’m falling\nin again\n\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high tide\nhigh tide, high tide, high\n\nFeels like I’m falling in again\n\nBaby Queen\n\nI met the Princess from Thailand again\nShe had grown up into a Queen\nDown in the abyss where the night, never turns to daylight\n\nShe kept in a polaroid\nThat was pinned\nUpon her wall\n\nUnder Garuda’s mirrored eyes\nShe takes flight\nYeh the kids alright\n\nGrown up\nBaby Queen\n\nGrown up\nBaby Queen\n\nShe fell into the generals (baby Queen)\nOn the watch\nAll around\nHer\n\nI fell into the vanity\nThe mirrored nights\nOf my dreams\n\nAll blown up\nBaby Queen\n(In my dreams, where you be)\n\nGrown up\nBaby Queen\n(In my dreams, where you be)\n\nBaby Queen\n(In my dreams, where you be)\n\nGrown up\nBaby Queen\n(In my dreams, where you be)\n\nGrown up\nBaby Queen\n(In my dreams, where you be)\n\nGrown up\nBaby Queen\n(In my dreams, where you be)\n\nBaby Queen\nYou were in my dreams\n\nBroken\n\nDistance stars come in black or red\nI’ve seen their worlds inside my head\nThey connect with the fall of man\nThey breathe you in then dive as deep as they can\n\nThere’s nothing you can do for them\nThey are the force between when the sunlight is arising\nThere’s nothing you can say to him\nHe is in outer heart and the space has been broken\n\nIt’s broken\nOur love\nIt’s broken\nIt’s broken\nOur love\nBroken\n\nIs it far away in the glitter freeze\nOr in our eyes every time they meet\nIt’s by the light of the plasma screens\nWe keep switched on all through the night while we sleep\n\nThere’s nothing you can do for them\nThey are the force between when the sunlight is arising\nThere’s nothing you can say to her\nI am without a heart and the space has been broken\n\nIt’s broken\nOur love\nBroken\nIt’s broken\nOur love\nBroken\nIt’s broken\nOur love\nIt’s broken\nIt’s broken\nOur love\nBroken\n\nChalk Tablet Towers\n\nChalk Tablet towers\nLike drawing shadows\nChemical distractions\nYou are not with me\nI departed in the spring\nTo a distant star\nBut I could not get back\nI had gone too far\n\nOh oh oh\nI wanna get drunk\nI wanna get stoned\nI wanna give up\nI wanna go home\n\nWatching rockets take off\nFrom a parting sea\nHow will I ever touch you\nIf you are not with me\n\nOut here There’s only silence\nOut here No form of contact\nOut here I am dreaming\nLooking into darkness\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nOh oh ohh oh oh\nOh ohh ohh\n\nI won’t be back till the end of summer\nWill you still be there\nI won’t give up on you darling\nJust tell me that you care\nI don’t need to trophies\nNo cell with a view\nThere’s nothing I wouldn’t give\nOne minute with you\nYou\nYou oh oh oh oh oh oh\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nOh oh ohh oh oh ohh ohh\nOh ohh ohh\n\nCloud of Unknowing\n\nOn the cloud of unknowing\nMy world seems open\nEvery set of light up here is watching\nBut I was here from the very start\nTrying to find a way to your heart\n\nOh the days of forgetting\nThey’ve gone out with the tide\nLost at sea somewhere waiting\nLike setting suns at the rodeo\nTrying to find someone you never know\n\nOh sinking love on the cloud of unknowing\nEvery set of light up here is watching\nWaiting to see what the morning brings\nMay bring sunshine on its wings\n\nCracker Island\n\nOn cracker island it was born\nTo the collective of the dawn\nThey were planting seeds at night\n\nTo grow a made up paradise\nWhere the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)\nBut it’s sadness I consumed (forever cult)\nInto my formats everyday (forever cult)\nIn end I had to pay (what world is this)\nIn the end I had to pay (I purged my soul)\nIn the end I had to pay (I drank to riot)\nNothing more to say (I drank to riot)\n\nThey taught themselves to be occult\nThey didn’t know it’s many strategies\nThey taught themselves to be occult\nThey didn’t know it’s many strategies\nFantasies\n\nWhat world is this\nWhat world is this\n\nOn cracker island it was raised\nBy the collective from the grave\nIt only came out at night\nIt ate up their paradise (paradise)\nWhere the truth was auto tuned (forever cult)\nAnd its sadness I consumed (forever cult)\nInto my formats everyday (forever cult)\nIn the end I had to pay (what world is this)\nOut there on my Silver Lake (I was not there)\nIn the end it will be great (beneath the hills)\nI’m like a ship between the tides (I saw myself)\nI held on I survived (there in the void)\n\nThey taught themselves to be occult\nThey didn’t know it’s many strategies\nThey taught themselves to be occult\nThey didn’t know it’s many strategies\nFantasy\n\nOn cracker island It will die (forever cult)\nJoin the collective in the sky (forever cult)\nAnd on a shining boat of light (forever cult)\n\nGo up to paradise (what world is this)\nWhere the truth is autotuned (I purged my soul)\nAnd its sadness I consume (I drank to riot)\nInto my formats everyday (I drank to riot)\nIn the end I had to pay (forever cult)\n\nIn the end I’ll have to pay (forever cult)\nIn the end I’ll be ok (forever cult)\n\nNothing more to say\nNothing more to say\nNothing more to say\n\nCrocadillaz\n\nSin to cinnamon\nTasty destruction\nEarth level angles fade and tucked in\nYour four corners\nParade in seduction\nPretty veneer boys step to the rear\nIma play the chairman\nAnd step to the chair\nIt’s the darling of it all\nCarvings on the wall\nTag the A-train to Altamira\nLife is intoxicating\nI need to beeeeeer-witness\nthe master I.C.\nGot the hammer ‘pon cock\nThe dawn ain’t stopping\nSo the rocking don’t stop\nThe reign hasn’t fallen\nSo the farmer won’t crop\nThe price of fame will not drop\nRicochet baby never the Bull’s eye\nYou can play sheep\nBut beware of the wolves eye\nHypnotized by the crocodile’s smile\nThe exchange is brief\nSo watch for the teeth\n\nSend the healing (I can get crocodile)\nThey need it, talk\nOhhh Look at things (I can get crocodile)\nSay less Talk (I can get crocodile)\nTime of mindfulness (I can get crocodile)\nPrior to making changes\nOhh look at things (I can get crocodile)\nNo regrets\nSuccess (I can get crocodile)\n\nDooodle doodle do do do, uhhhhuhhh\n(I can get crocodile)\nMmmmhmmmm\nDooodle doodle do do do, uhhhhuhhh\n(I can get crocodile)\nMmmmhmmmm\n\nRicochet basics\nBouncin’ off the wall\nCrocodile emblems\nThey says it all\nGrinning beginnings\nTurn into bites\nYou can hide ya hand\nBut you can’t hide the yikes\nTeeth lined in Ivory\nBouncing off the wall\nGatorade sippin’\nThat say it all\nHiding’ ya hand\nBut you can’t hide the yikes\nGood rhythm good vibes\nAnd an Uber good night\n\nDARE\n\nIt’s coming up,\nit’s coming up,\nit’s coming up,\nit’s coming up,\nit’s coming up,\nit’s coming up,\nit’s DARE.\n\nIt’s

By chance\nthey stumbled upon the place where\nall good souls come to rest.\nThe strange folk they coveted\nthe jewels from these caves above all\nthings, and soon they began\nto mine the mountain. Its rich\nseam fuelling the chaos of their own\nworld. Meanwhile,\ndown in the town the\nhappy folk slept restlessly, their\ndreams invaded by shadowy figures, digging\naway at their sould. Every\nday, people would wake and\nstare at the mountain. Why was it bringing\ndarkness into their lives?\nAnd as the strange folk mined\ndeeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear,\nbringing with them a cold and\nbitter wind that chilled the very soul of the\nmonkey. For the first time the happy\nfolk felt fearful for they\nknew that soon the monkey would stir from\nits deep sleep. And then came a\nsound, distant at first, that\ngrew and a castrophony so immense\nthat it could be heard far away in\nspace. There were no\nscreams, there was no\ntime, the mountain called\nmonkey had spoken.\nThere was only fire and then…\nnothing.\n\nOh little town in U.S.A.\nthe time has come to see,\nit’s nothing you believe you are.\nBut where were you when it all came\ndown on me?\nDid you call me?\n\nFire Flies\n\nIf you see me floating too many times\nMy face will be painted in these white brick lines\nCos all

corrupted in factories far away\n\nHere we go again\nThat’s electric\nYour loves like rhinestones falling from the sky\nThat’s electric\nWe are future pixels in factories far away\nHere we go again\nThat’s electric\nYour loves like rhinestones falling from the sky\nThat’s electric\nWhere future pixels in factories far away\nHere we go again\n\nSevered Head\n\nSevered Head, Severed Head\n\nI’ve been losing everything, yeh\nI can’t keep a fucking thing, yeh\nDo the money, do the fame\nIt’s seems like that controls this thing\nGuess my head just left the building\nLike out the window missed the ceiling\nI cannot explain this feeling\nI never learnt to speak a zillion languages (stay a little longer)\nAnd still my body left me bleeding\nRoll the train it’s passing fast\nIt’s speeding out side\nMy body gone don’t need the soul, ey\nJust take another breathe or so\nFound on my torso\nI mean my neck go but where did my heart go\nI mean my neck go but where did my heart go\nI mean my leg go but where did my mind go\nI guess I only gotta go where the body goes\n\nStay a little longer\nParadise has mountains that take a lifetime\nTo climb in dreams I fly above them\nI’m haunted by what I saw last night\nOn angelic highways\nWaiting in the darkness\nOn a speeding train\nI stick my head out of the carriage window\nMy cheeks inflate, my eyes become watery\nWhoosh, my head is severed\n\nWill you stay a little longer\n\nCondensation makes pathways down a window pane\nI don’t really wanna watch you drive away\nWhat do you say?\nMaybe you could stay for another day\nOh baby wait\nI’ve been grinding teeth awake in bed\nAnd my aching head\nHow could love suddenly be dead\nWe could shallow bread\nOur hunger is not easily fed\nI’ve been waiting for sleep to come\nI’ve been breathing through these aching lungs\nI keep waking up\nThis is worse than ever breaking up\nIf your time is up\nHow much more before mine is up?\n\nUh huh, the roundabout, the vibe is nice\nWe all will die\nYeh, I mean the roundabout, life is nice\nWe all gon die, right?\nUh oh the roundabout, the vibe is nice\nWe all will die\nYeh, I mean the whole roundabout, me life is nice\nWe all gon die, yeh\n\nSilent Running\n\nStop cos you’re killing me\nYou brought me back and made me feel free\nRowdy waves and your energy\nYou pulled me fragile from the wreckage\n\nI got so lost

look hot but the beats cold\nAnd the speech goes like hi little lady, sex on a beach\nWanna try for a baby word in the village I’m a little bit crazy\nSwagger on a hundred degrees no eighty\nLook if heaven had a VIP this is it white sand blue sea\nBut I don’t know who they are\nand I’m damn sure they don’t know me\nBut I come in peace\n\nWhite Flag, white flag\nNo war no guns no poor just life\nJust love no hype just fun no ties\nJust me and my mic just me and my wife\nBut tell me if I’m dreaming\nCos I don’t want to wake up till the evening\nAnd I don’t want to be left sleeping\nfrom all the diseases that I breathe in\nLook respect the island no stealing\nAnd don’t bring religion here no three kings\nIntegrated and we ain’t leaving\nWe come on a peace thing\nWhite flag white flag\n\nWhite Light\n\nWhite light,\nwhite light,\nalcohol, alcohol, alcohol,\nwhite light.\n\nWhite light,\nwhite light,\nwhite light,\nalcohol, alcohol, alcohol,\nwhite light.\n\nWhite light,\nwhite

cloud\nSimply ’cause I just dreamt too much\nBlack sheep but I am all blue now\nIt’s the start, but I’ve done blew up\nI haven’t done none, yeah the travel’s tough\nLight white sands and the waves too far\nThey said no, I said that’s too tough\nWent to Google bombed their systems down\n\nEx niggas, blowing up my DMs\nWanna meet for lunch, breakfast or a dinner\n\nBanesidina, asidiki,
