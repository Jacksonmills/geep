Their partnership led to a music video and an EP being produced entirely through solar energy.\n\nVol. 1 – We Got The Power | Vol. 2 – A Solar Collaboration\n\nVOL. 1 – WE GOT THE POWER\n\nThe first half of the project was a music video for We Got The Power, done entirely with solar power.\n\nBehind the scenes.\n\nVOL. 2 – A SOLAR COLLABORATION\n\nRelease dates:\n\nFrequency (No Dormir): 30th June 2017\nMeadows: 12th December 2017\nSzél: 13th December 2017\nA Solar Collaboration: March 2018\n\nThe second half of the project was an EP with various new artists collaborating in the studio; resulting in three tracks released via E.ON’s SoundCloud account (that were taken down in 2018). There was an orange translucent vinyl pressing limited to 150 copies that were (mostly) given to competition winners in countries where the EP was recorded; a “Special Edition” with a glow-in-the-dark sleeve was also planned, but never got made.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide A –\nLao Ra x Lully x Throwing Shade – Frequency (No Dormir)\nRIP Swirl x MazeOne – Meadows\nSide B –\nKram Berev x Kapitány Máté x Ress – Szél\nShare this:\nTwitterFacebookPrint\nLoading..."
