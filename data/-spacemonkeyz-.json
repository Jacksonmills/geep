The band (in real life) is made up of Darren Galea, Richie Stevens & Gavin Dodds, a trio who got their start as Spacemonkeyz with the Gorillaz B-side, Tomorrow Dub. This soon led to the group getting a remix album, Laika Come Home. A remix album for Demon Days was also planned, but it was eventually scrapped.\n\nLore | Music | Videos\n\nLORE\n\nThe Spacemonkeyz (D-Zire, Dubversive & Gavva) were 3 chimps from the second generation of mutated offspring, descended from the monkeys sent into space during the Cold War. The trio consider Laika their god and have been searching for her across all of space. During their search, they stumbled across Kong Studios whilst Gorillaz were touring America in 2002; 2D had left the studio unlocked, allowing the trio to break in, steal the Gorillaz master tapes & create a remix album. Its release behind the band’s back infuriated Murdoc, regardless of the positive reviews the album received.\n\nMUSIC\nLaika Come Home [versus Gorillaz]\n\nRelease date: 1st July 2002\n\nFormats: Enhanced CD / CD / 12″ Vinyl\n\nA remix album of tracks from Gorillaz.\n\nTracklist:\n\nJungle Fresh\nStrictly Rubbadub\nBañana Baby\nMonkey Racket\nDe-Punked\nP.45\nDub Ø9\nCrooked Dub\nMutant Genius\nCome Again\nA Fistful of Peanuts\nLil’ Dub Chefin’ / Strictly Rubbadub (Extended)\nMensch [vs. Grönemeyer]\n\nRelease date: 3rd September 2002\n\nFormats: 12″ Vinyl\n\nReleased only in Germany, this EP contains various remixes of Herbert Grönemeyer’s single, Mensch; from the album of the same name.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide A –\nMensch (Master Remix)\nMensch (Instrumental)*\nSide B –\nMensch (Dub)\nMensch (St Entienne)\n\n*An instrumental of Mensch (Master Remix).\n\nLil’ Dub Chefin’ [versus Gorillaz]\n\nRelease date: 22nd July 2002\n\nFormats: Enhanced CD / 10″ Vinyl\n\nReleased only in the UK, this was the only single from Laika Come Home.\n\nB-sides:\n\nLil’ Dub Chefin’ (Radio Edit)\nSpace Monkeyz Theme [Spacemonkeyz]\nVirgin Souls – Snakes and Ladders (Spacemonkeyz Mix)\n\nRelease date: 2010\n\nFormats: Digital\n\nThis release isn’t classed as a major single; it was released on Spacemonkeyz’ MySpace account.\n\nStrictly Rubbadub (Live on Radio 1)\n\nRelease date: 10th February 2012\n\nFormats: Digital\n\nThis release isn’t classed as a major single, it’s a live performance of Slow Country (Strictly Rubbadub) from 2002; released via Gavin Dodds’ SoundCloud account.\n\nLil’ Dub Chefin’ (Live at Radio 1)\n\nRelease date: 13th February 2012\n\nFormats: Digital\n\nThis release isn’t classed as a major single, it’s a live performance of M1 A1 (Lil’ Dub Chefin’) from 2002; released via Gavin Dodds’ SoundCloud account.\n\nGorillaz – Tomorrow Comes Today\n\nRelease date: 25th February 2002\n\nFormats: DVD / CD / 12″ Vinyl\n\nA remix of Gorillaz – Tomorrow Comes Today by Spacemonkeyz; notably their debut track.\n\nTrack: 3.
