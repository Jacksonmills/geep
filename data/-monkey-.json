It retold the story of the novel Journey to the West, with Damon & Jamie’s own influences; most notably the Japanese show Saiyūki (Monkey!). When shows would be performed, audiences asked if the soundtrack was available to buy, which led to Damon recording studio renditions of his score. However, he decided to rework each song into the style of Gorillaz; making it (in Damon’s words) a Gorillaz album in every aspect apart from the name. The opera ran from 2007 to 2009, with a brief return in 2013.\n\nMusic | Videos | Books\n\nMUSIC\nJourney to the West\n\nRelease date: 18th August 2008\n\nFormats: Digital / CD / 12″ Vinyl\n\nA studio adaptation of the opera’s score, reworking the music as if it was meant to be a Gorillaz album.\n\nTracklist:\n\nMonkey’s World\nMonkey Travels\nInto the Eastern Sea\nThe Living Sea\nThe Dragon King\nThe Iron Rod\nOut of the Eastern Sea\nHeavenly Peach Banquet\nBattle in Heaven\nO Mi To Fu\nWhisper\nTripitaka’s Curse\nConfessions of a Pig\nSandy the River Demon\nMarch of the Volunteers\nThe White Skeleton Demon\nMonk’s Song\nI Love Buddha\nMarch of the Iron Army\nPigsy in Space\nMonkey Bee\nDisappearing Volcano\nMonkey Bee\n\nRelease date: 2008\n\nFormats: CD (Promo)\n\nThe only single from Journey to the West.\n\nTracklist:\n\nMonkey Bee (Radio Edit)\nMonkey Bee\nMonkey Bee (Remixes)\n\nRelease date: 22nd December 2008\n\nFormats: Digital\n\nTracklist:\n\nMonkey Bee (Radio Edit)\nHeavenly Peach Banquet\nMonkey Bee (Kwes.
