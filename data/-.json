All of the band members are fictitious cartoon characters with significant roles in the band, their own musical backgrounds and developed backstories; paired with personalities that make them compelling characters worth following as the story of their career continues to progress over the years.\n\nTHE BAND MEMBERS\nTHE STUDIO ALBUMS\nOTHER ESSENTIALS\nASSOCIATED WORKS\nTIMELINE OF THEIR CAREER\nLIST OF ALL THEIR RELEASED SONGS\nLIST OF ALL THEIR OFFICIAL LYRICS\nPAGE INDEX\n SA  Uncategorized  May 8, 2018 1 Minute\nFollow\n "
